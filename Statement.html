            "In our Pentecostal church, we hold a fundamental belief in the triune nature of God, affirming God as the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. We firmly believe that the Bible is the complete and inspired Word of God, without errors, serving as the ultimate authority in matters of faith, doctrine, and practice. Salvation is a transformative process that involves repentance from sin, the rejection of worldly desires, and the commitment to follow Jesus, with a rejection of the doctrines of Calvinism.

We believe in the manifestation of spiritual gifts by the Holy Spirit, emphasizing discernment to distinguish the genuine work of the Holy Spirit. The Church serves as a place for repentance, spiritual growth, and a beacon of love and transformation, bringing the world closer to God's love.

We highly recommend water baptism for believers as it symbolizes the invitation of the Holy Spirit into one's life. While not mandatory for salvation, it's a significant step in one's faith journey. We believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and a final judgment by God. Our tradition holds that all believers should engage in evangelism, whether on a grand scale or through everyday interactions, to share the message of Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, we emphasize holiness and sanctification, seeking to live set apart for God. Our worship practices are vibrant, expressive, and often include speaking in tongues, heartfelt singing, and the spontaneous movement of the Holy Spirit in our gatherings, as a means of drawing closer to God and experiencing His presence."
